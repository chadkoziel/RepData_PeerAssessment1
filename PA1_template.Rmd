This is an R Markdown document for Course Project 1 from Reproducible Research.  

###Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

#download raw data
data_temp <- tempfile()
download.file(
     "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",
     data_temp
)

steps_raw <- read.csv(unz(data_temp, "activity.csv"))
unlink(data_temp)

steps_raw$date <- as.Date(steps_raw$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

###Mean total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
steps_total_day <- steps_raw %>%
     group_by(date) %>%
     summarize(total_steps = sum(steps)) %>%
     filter(!is.na(total_steps))

annotation_text1 <-
     paste(paste("Mean = ", mean(steps_total_day$total_steps), sep = ""),
           paste("Median = ", median(steps_total_day$total_steps), sep = ""),
           sep = "\n")

ggplot(data = steps_total_day, aes(steps_total_day$total_steps)) +
     geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000) +
     labs(x = "Total Steps", y = "Count of Days") +
     annotate("text",
              x = 2500,
              y = 8,
              label = annotation_text1)
```

###What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
steps_mean_interval <- steps_raw %>%
     filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
     group_by(interval) %>%
     summarize(mean_steps = mean(steps))

annotation_text2 <-
     paste("The interval with the ",
           "maximum number of steps:",
           steps_mean_interval[[which.max(steps_mean_interval$mean_steps), 1]],
           sep = "\n")

ggplot(data = steps_mean_interval, aes(x = interval, y = mean_steps)) +
     geom_line() +
     labs(x = "Interval", y = "Mean Number of Steps") +
     annotate("text",
              x = 300,
              y = 150,
              label = annotation_text2)
```

###Imputing missing values
Imputing missing values via the mean of the interval.
```{r}
steps_imputed <- steps_raw %>%
     left_join(by = "interval", steps_mean_interval) %>%
     mutate(steps = as.integer(ifelse(is.na(steps), mean_steps, steps))) %>%
     mutate(dataset = "Imputed")

steps_total_day_imputed <- steps_imputed %>%
     group_by(date, dataset) %>%
     summarize(total_steps = sum(steps)) %>%
     select(date, total_steps, dataset)


raw_imputed_summary <- data.frame(c("Mean","Median","Std.Dev."),c(mean(steps_total_day_imputed$total_steps),
median(steps_total_day_imputed$total_steps),
sd(steps_total_day_imputed$total_steps)),
c(mean(steps_total_day$total_steps),
median(steps_total_day$total_steps),
sd(steps_total_day$total_steps)))

colnames(raw_imputed_summary) <- c("Statistic","Imputed","Raw")

ggplot(data = steps_total_day_imputed, aes(x = steps_total_day_imputed$total_steps)) +
     geom_histogram() +
     labs(x = "Total Steps", y = "Count of Days")
```
The below table shows that the imputed mean and median are slightly lower than in the raw data.  This implies that missing data were disproportionately from intervals were activity was lower.  

The standard deviation of the imputed data, however, is significantly lower, as we would expect by adding more "mean" data.
```{r}
raw_imputed_summary
```

###Differences between weekdays and weekends
```{r}
steps_interval_imputed <- steps_imputed %>%
     mutate(day_type = ifelse(
          weekdays(date) == "Saturday" |
               weekdays(date) == "Sunday",
          "Weekend",
          "Weekday"
     )) %>%
     group_by(interval, day_type) %>%
     summarize(mean_steps = mean(steps))

ggplot(data = steps_interval_imputed, aes(x = interval, y = mean_steps)) +
     geom_line() +
     facet_grid(day_type ~ .) +
     labs(x = "Interval", y = "Mean Steps")
```
